// Description: Softuart
/* This Modul is software UART interface wich is implementet for the Attiny48. It is probably also useable for other microcontroller from this serie but in most cases
you have to adjust the names of the registers etc. */

#define XTAL 8000000 // This define is the timebase frequency who is used to calculate every time depending things.
// It is very important that this frequency is accurate. If you use the internal clock soure its very important to concern about the accuracy and tolerance.
// In that case you have to adjust the internal clock source. Because the internal clock source has a tolerance of +-10%.
// There are some registers where you can correct and adjust the internal clock source. For more information you have to check the datasheet of your microcontroller
